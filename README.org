A minimal Emacs configuration tailored for daily programming tasks in languages like Julia and Rust, working with notes in org-mode and markdown, and documents in Typst. Built with an eye-appealing UI, especially for coding.

* Overview

This is a personal, minimal configuration that covers my daily workflow:
- Programming in Julia, Rust, Python, Nix, and a few other languages
- Note-taking and knowledge management with org-mode
- Writing in markdown and Typst
- An aesthetically pleasing UI optimized for coding

The configuration uses modern Emacs features (tree-sitter, Eglot) with sensible defaults and optional Vim emulation. You can toggle between Vim and Emacs editing styles with ~C-c T~.

* Installation

** Requirements
- Emacs 29.1+ (for tree-sitter support)
- Git
- A Nerd Font (recommended: JetBrains Mono Nerd Font)

** Quick Start

1. Backup your existing configuration and clone this repository:
   #+begin_src bash
   mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.backup
   git clone https://github.com/ehsanirani/eemacs ~/.emacs.d
   #+end_src

2. Create your personal configuration:
   #+begin_src bash
   cd ~/.emacs.d
   cp config-sample.el config.el
   #+end_src

3. Edit ~config.el~ with your personal settings (name, email, org directory, font, theme)

4. Launch Emacs. Packages will install automatically on first launch.

5. After first launch, run:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   M-x treesit-install-missing-grammars
   M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts
   #+end_src

* Structure

The configuration is organized into modular files in the ~modules/~ directory, each handling a specific aspect (UI, completion, programming languages, org-mode, etc.). Your personal settings go in ~config.el~ (not tracked by git).
